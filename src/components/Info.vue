    <h2>EggDentifier</h2>
    <p>This website is dedicated to identifying eggs from Monster Hunter Stories.</p>
    <p>
      When playing Monster Hunter Stories, I got tired of scrolling through sites trying
      to figure out which egg is which, so I made this site.
    </p>
    <p>The primary feature of this site is the ability to filter eggs by type, color, etc.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      The data in this site (ex. colors) may not be entirely accurate to the game!
      The reason for this is because I wanted to focus more on the ability to find eggs,
      rather than be 100% game-accurate. Otherwise, we'd have about 50 shades of
      green, blue, and orange, which would make filtering nearly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, I tried to focus on having two shades of each distinct color.
      This leads to some oddities. If an egg appears to have no pattern on a variation
      (excluding great poogie), or the variations appear to have duplicates (excluding tower monsters and
      great poogie), then you should interpret it as "the colors are very very
      similar".
